## Portfolio Projects
Here is a brief overview of my projects. Click on the links to see the full project details.

### Cityspot

**Overview:**  
CitySpot is a data-driven project designed to help individuals choose the best city to live in based on their lifestyle and priorities. By aggregating global data on cost of living, safety, healthcare, climate, and inclusivity, CitySpot transforms raw information into actionable insights. Using Python for data cleaning and EDA, and Power BI for interactive visualization, the project enables users to easily compare cities and discover their ideal destination.

**Goal:**  
* Collect and structure socio-economic, cultural, and environmental data from reliable sources.  
* Analyze and compare different destinations based on key criteria.  
* Develop an interactive dashboard in Power BI for visualization and personalized recommendations.  

**Tools / Skills Used:**  
- Python (Google Colab): data cleaning, EDA (Matplotlib / Seaborn), modeling (K-Means, classification)  
- Excel: initial data inspection, calculations, quality checks  
- Power Query: advanced data transformation  
- Power BI: interactive dashboard, key indicators visualization  

**Result:**  
CitySpot demonstrates that multi-source data can guide individuals in choosing cities that match their lifestyle. Analysis shows cost of living alone isn’t reliable; safety, healthcare, climate, and social inclusion are key. Regional patterns highlight Europe’s premium healthcare vs. Asia’s high quality of life at lower cost.
