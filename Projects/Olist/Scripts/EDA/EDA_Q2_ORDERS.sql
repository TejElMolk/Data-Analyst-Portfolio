Question 2: Monthly Orders Analysis (Aug 2016 â€“ Aug 2018)
================================================================================

Objective / Business KPI:
- Calculate the total number of orders placed each month.
- Analyze **monthly growth** in orders.
- Identify **seasonality trends** using a seasonal index.

Limitations:
- All order statuses are included because the focus is on **orders placed**, not only fulfilled ones.
- Late 2016 and post-August 2018 data are excluded due to incomplete records that would bias monthly analysis and seasonality trends.

Business Questions:
1. How many orders are placed each month between August 2016 and August 2018?
2. What is the **month-over-month growth rate** in the number of orders?
3. What are the **seasonality patterns** in orders using the seasonal index (ratio of monthly orders to yearly average)?
